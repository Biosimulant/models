# models (Meta Index)

This repository is a lightweight index for the split `models-*` repositories.

## Security Scanning

- CI runs `gitleaks` on every push and pull request via `.github/workflows/security.yml`.
- Local commits can be scanned with pre-commit:
  - `pip install pre-commit detect-secrets`
  - `pre-commit install`
  - `pre-commit run -a`
