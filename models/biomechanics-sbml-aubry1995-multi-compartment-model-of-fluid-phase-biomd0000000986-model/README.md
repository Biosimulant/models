**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000986)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Laurence Aubry; Gérard Klein; Jean-Louis Martiel; Michel Satre

## Description

Fluid-phase endoeytosis (pinocytosis) kinetics were studied in Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae from the axenic strain Ax-2 that exhibits high rates of fluid-phase endoeytosis when cultured in liquid
