**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Yu Rong; Yatao Bian; Tingyang Xu; Weiyang Xie; Ying Wei

## Description

This model has been trained using the GROVER embedding with the QM8 dataset from Molecule Net, where the electronic properties have been calculated by multiple quantum mechanic methods. Model Type: Mo


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
