# Sivery2016 - A mammalian heat shock response model

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2201210001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Aude Sivéry; Emmanuel Courtade; Quentin Thommen

## Description

Environmental stress, such as oxidative or heat stress, induces the activation of the heat shock response(HSR) and leads to an increase in the heat shock proteins (HSPs) level. These HSPs act as molec
